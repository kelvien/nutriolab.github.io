## Notes
- Assets/media are stored in the [assets/media directory](/assets/media)
- If values contain weird text like `<span class='underline'><b>We are the extension of your team</b></span>`, it's because it needs some styling/formatting. That syntax is HTML syntax. Refer to Google on how to use HTML and CSS syntaxes if you need to style/format your text.
